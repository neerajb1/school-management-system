# Project Rules for School Management System

## 1. Data Source
- Always use `fetch()` to retrieve data from local JSON files located in `/public/api/`.
- Never suggest or use external APIs or backend services.

## 2. No Backend
- Do not suggest `axios`, `apiService`, or any calls to `localhost:5001`.
- This is a frontend-only demo and does not rely on a backend.

## 3. Component Integrity
- When refactoring, **NEVER delete** the following components:
  - `FilterBar`
  - `NoticeBoard`
  - `Sidebar`
  - Layout wrappers (e.g., `div` or `section` elements that structure the UI).

## 4. Single File Logic
- Use `students.json` for both student lists and student details.
- Always use `.find(s => s.id === Number(id))` to retrieve specific student details.

## 5. UI Style
- Strictly use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- Use **Lucide-React** icons for all icons.
- Maintain the 'Slate' professional theme for consistent UI design.
- Tables: Always use the .admin-table-container wrapper and .admin-table class. Do not use raw HTML table borders.

## 6. Rule Compliance
- These rules must be checked and followed before generating any code.
